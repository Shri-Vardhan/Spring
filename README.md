Spring Framework & Spring Boot
==============================
This repository is dedicated to hands-on learning and practical execution of programs using the Spring Framework and Spring Boot.

The main branch is intentionally kept empty and serves as a stable reference point for the repository.

All implementation work is organized and maintained across individual branches.

Repository Purpose
------------------
The goal of this repository is to:

Practice and implement Spring Framework and Spring Boot concepts

Maintain clean separation between reference and experimentation

Demonstrate structured, hands-on learning through branch-based development

Main Branch Policy
------------------
Nothing is implemented on the main branch.

No source code

No runnable applications

No experimental changes

The main branch exists only to:
------------------------------
Provide repository-level documentation

Act as a stable entry point

Maintain professional version control discipline

Branch-Based Development

All practical work is available in separate branches.

Each branch represents:
----------------------
A specific Spring or Spring Boot concept

Hands-on execution and experimentation

Working examples and learning exercises

Please refer to individual branches to review:
---------------------------------------------
Spring Core concepts

Dependency Injection

Annotations and configuration

Spring MVC

Spring Boot applications

REST APIs and related features

How to Explore
--------------
Switch from the main branch to any feature or topic-specific branch

Review the source code and configurations in that branch

Run and experiment with the implementations as needed

Intended Audience
=================
This repository is suitable for:
-------------------------------
Developers learning Spring Framework

Developers practicing Spring Boot

Reviewers evaluating hands-on framework experience

Personal reference and structured experimentation

Notes
-----
Branch names reflect the concept or feature implemented

Code is focused on learning and execution, not production deployment

The repository evolves as new Spring concepts are explored
